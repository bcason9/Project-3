# Project-3

Our project is important because we care about addressing the issues facing our planet's climate. By reducing or eliminating our meat intake, we can drastically reduce the amount of damage done to the environment by the meat industry. Tracy and Ben are vegetarians and aspiring vegans, and Johnny has drastically reduced his meat consumption thanks to products from Impossible meats and Beyond meats and is an aspiring vegetarian.
